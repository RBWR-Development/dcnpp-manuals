# Reactor Trip Breakers

The reactor is equipped with two essential components known as reactor trip breakers. These breakers play a critical role in the safe operation of the system. When power is removed from either one of these breakers, it effectively de-energizes the control rod drive mechanisms (CRDM), leading to the gravity-driven insertion of the control rods into the core.

## Tripping the Reactor:
In the event that a reactor trip is required, it is necessary to set the switch of any trip breaker to the "TRIP" position. This action promptly de-energizes the CRDMs, causing the control rods to descend into the core by means of gravity. Once the trip is complete and all the control rods are fully inserted, the trip breaker can be re-energized by setting the switch to the "IN" position.

## Automatic Reactor Trip:
During an automatic reactor trip, it is crucial to note that both reactor trip breakers will open simultaneously, ensuring the safety and proper functioning of the system.

## Monitoring Trip Breaker Status:
The position of a reactor trip breaker can be easily determined by observing the lights located above the switch. A red light indicates that the breaker is in the open position, while a green light signifies that it is closed. The Bypass breakers should never be closed during normal operation.

## Regular Maintenance and Breaker Checks:
Due to the rare possibility of breakers getting stuck, it is essential to perform regular checks to ensure their proper functioning. Regular maintenance activities should include inspection and testing of the breakers.

## Bypass Breaker Switches:
To facilitate the testing of trip breakers, the system is equipped with two Bypass breaker switches. These switches allow for the physical bypassing of a trip breaker, enabling safe testing procedures. Once a trip breaker has been bypassed, it can be tested by setting its switch to the "TRIP" position. Confirmation of proper functioning is indicated by the illumination of the red light on the breaker's switch. Resetting the trip breaker is achieved by returning the switch to the "IN" position. It is important to note that if the red light fails to illuminate during the test and the green light remains on, it indicates a potential issue with the trip breaker.

## Bypass Breaker Tripping and Interlock:
Upon completion of the testing process for a breaker, it is necessary to trip the bypass breaker by setting its switch to the "TRIP" position. It is important to be aware that an interlock mechanism is in place, preventing both bypass breakers from being engaged simultaneously. Attempting to activate both bypass breakers simultaneously will result in both breakers tripping open.

## Malfunctioning Breaker Protocol:
If a stuck or malfunctioning breaker is identified, the unit should be shut down immediately. Properly tag the malfunctioning breaker switch using the designated malfunction tag, and promptly notify a qualified technician to address the issue. In the event that both breakers are suck, power can be cut to bus [INSERT BUS HERE] to de-energize the CRDMs.

## Dual Breaker Stuck Scenario:
In the unlikely event that both reactor trip breakers become stuck for any reason, it is imperative to refrain from operating the unit under any circumstances. Immediate action should be taken to initiate a complete shutdown of the system to mitigate any potential risks or hazards.

Regular inspection, testing, and adherence to the outlined procedures for reactor trip breakers are essential to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the reactor system.
