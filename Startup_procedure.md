# Startup procedure

## Pressurizing water circuits

Initial heat up and pressurization is mainly done with use of main pressurizer heater (PZR HEATER S). This procedure is introduced because the reactor is very unstable during heating due to strong negative feedback from temperature of the water. During the heat up phase rods would have to be pulled to account for the raising temperature of water moderator while when RCP cooling is introduced, with steam generators still cold, cool water would be injected into the core causing an immediate and strong positive power spike which could lead to severe damage to the unit. On the other hand heater is a reliable power source not influenced by water physics at all.
During heating, pressurizer should be monitored. In the initial phase all 4 heaters should be enabled which will increase temperature of the pressurizer giving comfortable distance for the main circuit from water boiling point. RCP should be enabled to around 5-10% to initially mix water between both legs (heater is installed in the left leg) and to initially pressurize the secondary water circuit. Boron concentration should be reduced to around 50% by diluting water in the primary. All preheaters in the secondary should be enabled and also steam injection into boron evaporator should be enabled, so it can be used later.

With temperature increasing in the primary above 200 degrees, more RCP flow should be introduced to pressurize the secondary circuit and to reduce temperature differences between hot and cold leg (cold leg strongly feels water temperature in the steam generator). Initially due to imbalance caused by the heater only left steam generator will start producing steam, its feed water valve should be adjusted accordingly to maintain proper water level. In the meantime, condenser should be configured by enabling both CARs, two SJAE and enough circulation flow to build vacuum level to 40-70 mbar.

The goal parameters are around 280 degrees in the primary and few tenths of bars (up to 70) of pressure in the secondary with about 120 bars of pressure in the primary. At this stage if enough pressure is built, pressurizer heaters can be disabled or reduced. Before reaching these parameters, the reactor can be started, but it shouldn't reach heat gaining levels (9-10 levels of the IPR) until temperature difference between hot and cold leg in of both primary circuits drop below 10 degrees and both circuits are at the same temperature.

## Reactor startup

The reactor should be put into run mode and then group 01 rods should be pulled to maximum. These rods remain fully out during operations and serve a purpose of quick scram rods in case it would be needed. In the next step other rods can be pulled with outside rods pulled more than inside as the centre of the core tends to heat much quicker. Typical SUR for reactor startup should be held at 0.5 with up to 0.8 decades if quicker startup is needed. IPR should be monitored and incremented. At around the 5th level of IPR, the pressurizer heater should be disabled and RVP flow reduced significantly to maintain a temperature of around 280 degrees in the primary. At the moment when the heater is disabled a sudden increase in reactivity could happen which may require slight push back of the rods, although if cooling is reduced this shouldn't pose a problem. At this stage operator should be sure that primary circuit has proper parameters i.e. temperature around 280 degrees, and less than 10 degrees difference between hot and cold leg for both circuits. If pressure in the secondary build up to 70 bars, the bypass should be opened slightly to maintain operational pressure of 70 bars at all the time.

## Heat building

Initially operator should aim at around 480 MWt which is 20% of nominal reactor power. RCV flow should be adjusted to allow for steady temperature building over 300 degrees. While that happens, reactivity will be naturally suppressed, so constant rods pull might be required. Finally, parameters should be stabilised at this stage with 300 degrees in the primary at a pressure 120 bars and 278 degrees in the secondary with pressure at 70 bars. Primary temperature should be stabilised with RCP flow, and pressurizer heaters can be used to increase pressure up to 150 bars. Secondary pressure should be stabilised with proper bypass valve setting and water should be fed to both steam generators to maintain constant levels. At this stage also some balancing of the core could be done observing power range monitors.

From this moment when core is satisfactory balanced, no more rods' movement should be applied. Reactor should respond to steam demand changes and small adjustments should be done with boron injection/dilution.

## Turbine run-up

The turbine is started with TURBINE STOP switch. Initially, the turbine valve should be opened to around 5% and bypass closed accordingly to maintain a constant pressure of 70 bars. If done correctly, this should have no impact on the reactor, although small adjustments with boron concentration could be required. Maintaining constant pressure in the secondary is crucial to keep the reactor stable. Once turbine RPM reach around 3600, turbine valve will have to be closed to maintain this value while bypass again opened to maintain pressure. Turbine should be synced at 3600 RPM with synchroscope pointing top. After synchronization, bypass can be closed and turbine valve should be adjusted to maintain constant pressure of 70 bars.

## Meeting network demand

PWR reactor physics work in a way, where steam demand should automatically adjust reactor power to meet the demand. This process is caused by interactions between both water circuits and the reactor itself. Let's assume that from a steady state of 480 MWt (which should give around 120 MWe) we open the turbine valve to immediately get 200 MWe. In that case, pressure in the secondary will obviously drop, reducing the boiling point. Lower boiling point will reduce water temperature in the secondary. This will increase the temperature difference between primary and secondary. The primary cold leg will get cooler and this will reduce temperature in the reactor. Lower temperature in the reactor hence higher water density will increase moderation and reactor power will raise. This will increase temperature in the hot leg, which will increase steam generation in the secondary naturally meeting the demand set by the turbine valve. Therefore, the reactor should more or less stabilise in higher power and required steam demand, although some small adjustments can be required.

This whole process has one drawback, which is higher temperature in the hot leg of the primary circuit. If we started the process at 300 degrees, we still can let the temperature increase, although 320 degrees is the maximum allowed in the primary with 150 bars of pressure. Therefore, we should adjust RCP flow to maintain constant operational temperature.
