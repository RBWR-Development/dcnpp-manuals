## Reactor Protection System Overview

The Reactor Protection System (RPS) serves as a critical component designed to automatically shut down the reactor in case of any operational anomalies.

The RPS is organized into two distinct and physically isolated trains, each containing four channels. If a channel identifies an issue, it trips, indicated by the illumination of the corresponding "RPS-A/B CHANNEL TRIP" annunciator and the lighting up of the channel's pushbutton on the control panel.

If two channels within a single train trip, the entire train will trip, denoted by the "RPS TRAIN-A/B TRIP" annunciators.

Upon a train trip, the associated reactor trip breaker opens. Simultaneously, when the reactor trip breaker and its corresponding bypass breaker are open, power to the control rod drive mechanisms (CRDMs) is interrupted, allowing the rods to descend into the core.

### RPS Testing Procedures
Similar to various other components, regular testing is essential to ensure the proper functioning of RPS channels and prevent malfunctions that could impede their tripping capabilities. During testing, close the reactor trip bypass breaker for the specific train under examination. It's important to note that both bypass breakers cannot be closed simultaneously.

Subsequently, trip all RPS channels on the designated train by depressing their respective pushbuttons. If done correctly, the reactor should remain unaffected, regardless of the RPS train status. Functional RPS trains will result in all four channel pushbuttons lighting up, accompanied by the illumination of "RPS-A/B CHANNEL TRIP" and "RPS TRAIN-A/B TRIP" annunciators.

To conclude the test, reset the RPS train by depressing the respective "RPS A/B RESET" pushbutton and tripping the trip bypass breaker.
