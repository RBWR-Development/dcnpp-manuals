## Pressurizer

# Introduction

A pressurizer is a device located on the hot leg of the left part of primary circuit. Basically, it is a long, vertical pipe. The whole primary circuit is filled with water, while the water surface is in the pressurizer above the whole system, leaving some free space above it. The idea of the pressurizer is to initially boil some water from the primary circuit to fill the empty space with steam. The pressure of the steam will be felt by the whole primary system (as water is not contractible). It is very easy to change the pressure of the steam in this small volume above water level therefore, it is quite simple to maintain the desired pressure in the whole primary circuit.

# What affects pressure

Pressure will be affected by several factors:

- amount of steam
- temperature of steam
- volume of steam

The amount of steam will depend on the boiling of the water. Whenever the water in the pressurizer reaches its boiling point (which is defined by pressure), it will boil, adding some steam and reducing the water level. The temperature of steam mainly depends on the temperature of water in the primary, although it is possible to increase this temperature with pressurizer heaters. The volume of steam will depend on the water level inside the pressurizer. The water level will naturally expand during heating, increasing its level, but it will also drop due to boiling. Steam can also be changed back into water with the use of a water spray. Finally, makeup and drain valves are available to maintain proper water level.

# Operation of the pressurizer during startup

During startup, primary water will be heated by the PZR HEATER S and later on by the reactor itself. This influences mostly the temperature in the primary circuit. In a PWR-type reactor, it is important to maintain high pressure so that water doesn't boil in the whole primary circuit. Higher pressure gives a higher boiling point, and to feel comfortable, there should be at least 10-20 degree difference between the current boiling point and the primary water temperature. In order to achieve this, water can be heated in the pressurizer. During startup, all four heaters should be enabled. This will allow to boil just a little of the water that is in the pressurizer itself and increase pressure. Heaters should remain enabled during the whole procedure because if disabled, the pressurizer temperature would quickly be cooled down to that of the primary circuit. The goal pressure is around 120 bars which gives about 313 degrees of boiling point, which is enough for a normal operating temperature of 300 degrees. If the primary temperature is to be increased up to 320 degrees, the pressure should be increased to 150 bars giving 10 degrees of buffer from the boiling point at around 320 degrees. This is the maximum operational pressure and it should not be crossed. If reduction of pressure is required either water level can be reduced with a drain or water spray can be used.

# Normal operations

Typically, the primary circuit will work at around 300 degrees with a pressure of 120 bars. Usually, when enough pressure is built, heaters can be disabled. The pressurizer doesn't require a lot of attention, but if a higher operational temperature is required, additional steam can be added to the system with the heaters. Another way to control pressure would be to change the water level with makeup and drain valves. Caution is required when using them, as they can affect pressure strongly because the volume of the steam is quite small. If, for any reason, pressure becomes too high, water spray can be used. It will cause rapid condensation of the steam, reducing pressure but also increasing the water level.

# Operation during isolation of the left leg

If the left leg is isolated, pressurizer becomes cut of from the system. Temperature therefore can be increased with heaters independently of the core but the pressure doesn't affect primary anymore. It is assumed that primary system works under it's own water pressure independently of the pressurizer pressure. This is so called 'running solid' where expanding water will automatically increase pressure above boiling point independent of the pressurizer. It is therefore possible to temporarily run the reactor only on the right part of primary cooling system with one steam generator.

On the other hand if the right leg is isolated leaving pressurizer connected to the reactor the whole system will behave normally of course withouth possbility to use of the right steam generator.
