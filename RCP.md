# Reactor Coolant Pumps (RCPs)

The Reactor Coolant Pumps (RCPs), also referred to as "Main Coolant Pumps" (MCPs), play a crucial role in circulating water throughout the primary loop of the reactor.

Dunscom NPP is equipped with four RCPs, with RCP-1 and RCP-2 serving as the primary pumps, while RCP-3 and RCP-4 act as redundant backup pumps.

The RCP-1 and RCP-3 pumps are responsible for circulating water through the left loop, whereas the RCP-2 and RCP-4 pumps handle the circulation in the right loop.

During normal operation, it is essential to utilize both the main and backup RCPs, distributing the load evenly between them.

## RCP Operation

The RCPs perform two primary functions:
1. Regulating flow into the steam generators.
2. Balancing the power distribution between the left and right sides of the reactor core by controlling the temperature coefficient.

By adjusting the flow rate of the RCPs, the corresponding side of the core can be cooled down or heated up, resulting in a proportional increase or decrease in power.

The RCPs play a pivotal role in achieving power balance between the left and right halves of the core, thereby ensuring optimal performance.

## Temperature Indication

The RCP panel features four temperature gauges, two for each loop, identified as Th1, Th2, Tc1, and Tc2.

Th1 and Th2 represent the hot leg temperature readings for each respective loop, while Tc1 and Tc2 indicate the temperature of the cold leg.

The operating temperature range for Th1 and Th2 is typically around 300, and it is essential to prevent them from exceeding 320. If the temperature surpasses 330, a reactor trip will be initiated as a safety measure.

Monitoring and maintaining appropriate temperatures within these specified limits are vital for the safe and reliable operation of the reactor coolant system.
