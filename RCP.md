# Reactor Coolant Pumps (RCPs)

The Reactor Coolant Pumps (RCPs), also referred to as "Main Coolant Pumps" (MCPs), play a crucial role in circulating water throughout the primary loop of the reactor.

Dunscom NPP is equipped with four RCPs, with RCP-1 and RCP-2 serving as the primary pumps, while RCP-3 and RCP-4 act as redundant backup pumps.

The RCP-1 and RCP-3 pumps are responsible for circulating water through the left loop, whereas the RCP-2 and RCP-4 pumps handle the circulation in the right loop.

During normal operation, it is essential to utilize both the main and backup RCPs, distributing the load evenly between them.

## RCP Operation

The RCPs perform two primary functions:
1. Regulating flow into the steam generators.
2. Balancing the power distribution between the left and right sides of the reactor core by controlling the temperature coefficient.

By adjusting the flow rate of the RCPs, the corresponding side of the core can be cooled down or heated up, resulting in a proportional increase or decrease in power.

The RCPs play a pivotal role in achieving power balance between the left and right halves of the core, thereby ensuring optimal performance.

## Temperature Indication

The RCP panel features four temperature gauges, two for each loop, identified as Th1, Th2, Tc1, and Tc2.

Th1 and Th2 represent the hot leg temperature readings for each respective loop, while Tc1 and Tc2 indicate the temperature of the cold leg.

The operating temperature range for Th1 and Th2 is typically around 300, and it is essential to prevent them from exceeding 320. If the temperature surpasses 330, a reactor trip will be initiated as a safety measure.

Monitoring and maintaining appropriate temperatures within these specified limits are vital for the safe and reliable operation of the reactor coolant system.

## Impact on reactor operations

Water temperature in the primary system (mainly in the cold leg) strongly affects reactivity. Therefore it is important to keep the temperature stable during operations. Nominal temperature for the hot leg is 300 drgrees which can be increased up to 320 degrees maximum temperature. Temperature of the cold leg will depend mostly on the hot leg but also on the temperature in the secondary circuit (steam generators water temperature). Higher temperature in the reactor will cause reactivity to drop. This is a general safety feature of the PWR which can be noticed if RCP pump trips for any reason. Although it also has a drawback - in case of suddent drop in temperature reactor power might dangerously spike. Therefore it is advised to increase RPC flow with great care all the time monitoring main reactor parameters.

Change of the primary flow will also affect the secondary. Increasing RCP flow will transfer more energy to the secondary therefore operator may expect raise in steam generation while the primary temperature drops. This will also increase reactor power which should more or less provide enough power to feed the increased steam generation. Therefore RCP flow might be used as a tool to change reactor power.

On the other hand secondary will also affect the primariy flow. If steam demand is increased (by opening turbine valve or bypass more) it will decrease temperature in the secondary which will also decrease temperature in primary cold leg. This will again increase power of the reactor which will try to meet the steam demand. Therefore also the secondary might be used to change reactor power which will have tendency to automatically meet steam demand.

It is important that operator understands these processes and runs the reactor mostly by adjusting the flows rather than moving rods or changing boron concentration too much.
