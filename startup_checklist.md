# Startup checklist

- RHR all off
- PZR S heater on
- PZR heaters 2-4 enabled
- Reactor coolant pumps 2 enabled at 15%
- Preheaters on
- Polisher on
- Electrical feedwater pumps - as required to maintain level in steam generators
- Reactor mode - IPR
- Shutdown rods latch
- Shutdown rods pull to maximum
- If SUR>0 after rods pulled, borate water to keep it at 0
- When core temp>250 increase cooling to about 30%
- Open bypass to around 30%
- Both CAR enabled
- SJAE x2 enabled at 100%
- Condenser recirc pumps both enabled at around 10%
- Keep condenser pressure 50-70 mbar
- Bypass - as required to maintain 50-70 bars in secondary
- When core temp>280 degrees set cooling pumps as required to maintain 280-300 degrees
- Check secondry parameters and adjust setting accordingly:
  - SG levels at 50%
  - pressure 50-70 bar
  - condenser pressure 50-70 mbar
- Latch and start pulling rods to around 50-70%
- When rods stopped at 50-70%
  - if SUR drops below 0.5, dilute water to keep SUR~0.5 constant
  - if SUR raises too much, borate water to keep SUR~0.5 constant
- IPR increment as required
- at IPR 10:
  - reactor switch to run mode
  - disable PZR S heater
- Push rods back to maintain constant ~480MWt power
- Reduce cooling to maintain 280-300 core temp
- Adjust SG feedwater pumps and bypass
- Turbine TRIP reset
- Turbine valve open to 30%
- Close Bypass
- At 3500 RPM synchroscope enabled
- Sync turbine at 3600 RPM with Gen-1 BRK closed
- Synchroscope disabled
- Turbine valve open to reach ~150 MWe load
- Monitor reactor power and primary core temperature, adjust accordingly
- Electrical feedwater pumps disable
- Steam driven feedwater pumps enable and adjust to maintain 50% SG level
