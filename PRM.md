# Power Range Monitors
Power Range Monitors (PRMs) serve as the primary means for measuring the thermal power of the reactor. There are a total of 12 PRMs strategically placed throughout the reactor to accurately gauge its thermal power. These PRMs play a crucial role in balancing and adjusting reactor power as needed.

Each PRM is positioned between four rods, enabling it to capture and display the average thermal power of that specific section. The readings obtained from the PRMs contribute to the calculation of two important parameters: Startup Rate (SUR) and Average Power Range Monitor (APRM). These values are derived by considering the thermal power measurements from all the PRMs collectively.

Keep in mind that the PRMs will not display accurate data below 100MWt.

By monitoring and analyzing the data provided by the PRMs, operators can effectively manage and optimize the reactor's power output. The PRMs contribute significantly to the overall control and stability of the reactor system, ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the power plant.
