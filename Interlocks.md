## Interlocks
Bloxinghouse Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) incorporate two distinct categories of interlocks:

1. Protection-Grade Interlocks (indicated by P-#)
2. Control-Grade Interlocks (indicated by C-#)

These interlocks are specifically engineered to safeguard the unit in defined situations that do not necessitate a reactor trip.

### Protection-Grade Interlocks (P-#)
- **P-4** | "REACTOR TRIP BREAKER CONTACT"

        - Trips main turbine
        - Isolates main feedwater
        - Input to SI block and reset logic
- **P-6** | "SOURCE RANGE BLOCK PERMISSIVE"

        - Enables BLOCK/RESET switches to allow operator to block SR high flux trip.
- **P-7** | "AT-POWER PERMISSIVE"
    - SETPOINT:
        - Power < 10%
    - FUNCTIONS:
        - Automatically blocks the "at-power" trips:
            - PZR PRESS LOW
            - PZR LEVEL HIGH
            - ALL RCS FLOW LOW
            - TURBINE TRIP

        - Automatically blocks the SINGLE LOOP FLOW LOW reactor trip.
- **P-9** | "TURBINE TRIP/REACTOR TRIP PERM."
    - SETPOINT:
        - Power Range Power < 50%
    - FUNCTIONS:
        - Blocks reactor trip on turbine trip below 50%
- **P-10** | "NUCLEAR AT-POWER BLOCK PERMISSIVE"
    - SETPOINT:
        - Power Range Power > 10%
    - FUNCTIONS:
        - Opens contacts to SR high voltage power supply
        - Enables BLOCK switches to allow operator to block IR high flux trip and rod stop.
        - Input to P-7
- **P-11** | "LOW PZR PRESS SI BLOCK PERMISSIVE"
    - SETPOINT:
        - PZR Pressure < 130 bar
    - FUNCTIONS:
        - Enables BLOCK switches to sllow operator to block low PZR pressure SI actuation
        - Removal of permissive provides open signal to CLA isolation valves
- **P-12** | "HIGH STEAM FLOW SI PERMISSIVE"
    - SETPOINT:
        - Tavg < 289°C
    - FUNCTIONS:
        - Enables BLOCK switches to allow operator to block high steam flow ESF actuation.
        - Input to high steam flow ESF actuation logic.
- **P-13** | "TURBINE AT-POWER PERMISSIVE"
    - SETPOINT:
        - Turbine power < 10%
    - FUNCTIONS:
        - Input to P-7
- **P-14** | "SG HIGH LEVEL OVERRIDE"
    - SETPOINT:
        - Steam generator level > 69%
    - FUNCTIONS:
        - Closes MFW regulating valves
        - Trips all main feed pumps
        - Trips main turbine
        - Closes all MFW isolation valves

### Control-Grade Interlocks (C-#)
- **C-1** | "IPRM HIGH FLUX ROD STOP"
    - SETPOINT:
        - IPRM power > equivilant to 20% power
    - FUNCTIONS:
        - Stops control rod outward motion (manual & automatic)
    - INTERLOCKS:
        - Blocked when IR trip is blocked.
- **C-2** | "POWER RANGE HIGH FLUX ROD STOP"
    - SETPOINT:
        - Power range power > 103%
    - FUNCTIONS:
        - Stops control rod outward motion (manual & automatic)

        - None
- **C-9** | "CONDENSER AVAILABLE INTERLOCK"
    - SETPOINT:
        - Condenser vacuum > 0.7bar
        - Condenser circ pump breaker closed
    - FUNCTIONS:
        - Ensures condenser is available for steam dump operation
