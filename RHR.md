## Residual Heat Removal

At this moment the system is only functional in RHR mode. There are two parts of the system for each side of the core. In order to cool the part of the core, corresponding recirculatiom, RHR pump and RHR IV need to be opened. System also has a switchover valve which allows mixing between both system. With switchover valve enabled, one recirculation pump can be used to cool down both parts of the core (if pumps and valves are enabled for both parts).
