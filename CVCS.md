# Chemical and Volume Control System (CVCS)

The Chemical and Volume Control System (CVCS) plays a crucial role in managing the boric acid concentration and maintaining the volume stability within the Reactor Coolant System (RCS). This is achieved by injecting or removing the appropriate amount of water from the RCS.

## Injecting Boric Acid:
The injection of boric acid is performed to regulate the reactivity of the core, especially during power changes. To carry out this procedure, please follow these steps:

- Activate the main boron pump and one of the two booster pumps by flipping the switches on the MAIN BORON TANK panel.
- Open the BORON IN valve on the RCS valves switches to allow the boric acid to enter the RCS.
- Once the desired injection is achieved, close the BORON IN valve and deactivate all the MAIN BORON TANK pumps.

## Removing Boric Acid:
The CVCS is responsible for removing boric acid from the RCS. This process involves extracting a portion of the reactor coolant and replacing it with fresh, uncontaminated coolant. Follow these steps to execute the boric acid removal procedure:

- Activate the main H2O pump and one of the two booster pumps by using the switches on the MAIN H2O TANK panel.
- Open the H2O IN and EXTRACT OUT valves on the RCS VALVES switches to initiate the coolant replacement process.
- Once the desired removal is accomplished, close both RCS VALVES and shut down the MAIN H2O TANK PUMPS.

## Cleaning up the Extracted Coolant:
To ensure that the incoming coolant during the boric acid removal process is clean and free of contaminants, it is necessary to filter the extracted coolant. Follow these steps for proper cleanup:

- Start the Feedwater Pump (FWP) on the EVAPORATOR switches to allow water to enter the evaporator.
- Open the STEAM OUT valve on the EVAPORATOR switches to release the evaporated steam from the evaporator.
- Once all the water has entered the evaporator, turn off the FWP.
- After all the water has completely evaporated into steam, close the STEAM OUT valve.
- To recover the boric acid from the evaporator, open the BORON OUT valve.
- Once all the boric acid has been drained from the evaporator, close the BORON OUT valve.
- To return the boric acid and water back into the main tanks, start the EVAP BORON PUMP and EVAP H2O PUMP, respectively.

By following these procedures, you can effectively manage the boric acid concentration within the Reactor Coolant System and ensure the proper functioning of the Chemical and Volume Control System (CVCS).
